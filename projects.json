Missing values, particularly ~6,000 in the 'Industry' column, were addressed using inference, replication, and manual research, while continent data was added for enhanced geographic analysis. The tool features multiple interactive dashboards: the first highlights top and low-performing countries based on revenue, profit, and market value, the second compares industries within a selected country, the third tracks industry growth trends over time, the fourth ranks companies by financial performance, and the fifth analyzes the financial evolution of selected companies. With Tableau-powered interactive charts and maps, users can filter, compare, and track financial performance, enabling data-driven investment decisions by identifying trends, growth, and financial stability. This tool transforms raw financial data into actionable insights, helping users explore industry patterns, compare companies, and make strategic investment choices.",
