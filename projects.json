The dataset consists of 10,000 skin lesion images classified as malignant or benign. Data preprocessing includes standardization, augmentation, and validation split for robust training. The model is trained using Binary Crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer, with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance. Evaluation metrics highlight significant improvements with ResNet18, achieving a test accuracy of 92%, recall of 0.89 (malignant), and 0.96 (benign). The project is deployed using Render & AWS and the frontend was developed using React whereas the models were developed using pyTorch.",

It merges five datasets, aligning columns, standardizing financial units, and resolving discrepancies. Missing values, particularly ~6,000 in the 'Industry' column, were addressed using inference, replication, and manual research, while continent data was added for enhanced geographic analysis. The tool features multiple interactive dashboards: the first highlights top and low-performing countries based on revenue, profit, and market value, the second compares industries within a selected country, the third tracks industry growth trends over time, the fourth ranks companies by financial performance, and the fifth analyzes the financial evolution of selected companies. With Tableau-powered interactive charts and maps, users can filter, compare, and track financial performance, enabling data-driven investment decisions by identifying trends, growth, and financial stability. This tool transforms raw financial data into actionable insights, helping users explore industry patterns, compare companies, and make strategic investment choices.",
